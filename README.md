The proposed solution is easy to reproduce and can be implemented by any person with minimal technical knowledge, or with the help of structures such as fab labs. Indeed, all the components of the proposed SWALKIT can be interconnected with GroveÂ® cables and prototyping cables. The Android SWALKIT app can be used to tune the system settings. This repository provide the necessary information to reproduce a Swalkit. The system housings are 3D-printed with flexible fit so that they can be adapted to other walker model form factors.
